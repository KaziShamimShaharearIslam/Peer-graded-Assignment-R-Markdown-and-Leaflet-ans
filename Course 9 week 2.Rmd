## Background
Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

## Assignment:

```{r}
library(leaflet)

m_map <- m_map %>% addMarkers(lat= 40.4395932, lng= -79.9893378, popup="Piitsburgh Penguins play here")
